# move_videos
## Move/separate videos from a photo collection (_i.e. Google Photos Takeout_)

When exporting Google Photos via Takeout there is no choice to download videos separately or to a different location. This program automates the process of moving videos from several folders to a different single location on your computer so you can:
- transfer your photos to a service like Amazon Photos that doesn't allow large amounts of video files.
- backup videos to a separate device/location
- keep file types organized

Steps:
1. Unzip target folder first if .zip
2. OPTIONAL: add/change extensions in code section '# add any other extensions desired'
3. Run Python script
4. At the prompt, choose the target folder
5. All video files will be located in the same directory as the target folder with the name '(target folder)_videos'
